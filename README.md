# RDoc Link Checker

A gem to find broken links in HTML files generated by Ruby RDoc.

Reports a link as broken if:

- The target page given by +href+ is not found.
- The target page is found, but the fragment given by +href+
  is not a link target on that page;
  this usually causes a browser to open at the top of the page
  instead of at the given fragment.

Note that some browsers are forgiving, and will open the target
page at a link target similar to the given fragment;
for example, fragment ```#bar``` may be opened at an element
with id ```foobar```.

See the [help text](doc/help.txt).
