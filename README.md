# RDoc Link Checker

A gem to find broken links in HTML files generated by Ruby RDoc.

Reports a link as broken if:

- The target page given by +href+ is not found.
- The target page is found, but the fragment given by +href+
  is not a link target on that page;
  this usually causes a browser to open at the top of the page
  instead of at the given fragment.

Note that some browsers are forgiving, and will open the target
page at a link target similar to the given fragment;
for example, fragment ```bar``` may be opened at an element
with id ```foobar```.

```
Usage:
rdoc_link_checker html_dirpath options

The argument is the path to a directory containing a tree
of RDoc-generated HTML files, such as those generated by command

rdoc --visibility=private --op html . # Note the trailing dot.

Options:
--onsite_only   Check link targets only on pages in the file tree at <html_dirpath>,
                and not those on other local pages or those on the web.
--no_toc        Do not check links on the TOC page (table_of_contents.html).
--version       Print the version and exit.
--help          Print this help and exit.

The output is file <html_dirpath>/Report.htm, which reports broken links.
