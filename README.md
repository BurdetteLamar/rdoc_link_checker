# RDocLinkChecker

A gem to find broken links in HTML files generated by Ruby RDoc.

Reports a link as broken if:

- The target page given by +href+ is not found.
- The target page is found, but the fragment given by +href+
  is not a link target (element with attribute <tt>id</tt>) on that page;
  this usually causes a browser to open at the top of the page
  instead of at the given fragment.

  Some browsers are forgiving, and will open the target
  page at a link target similar to the given fragment;
  for example, fragment ```#bar``` may be opened at an element
  with id ```foobar```.

See the [help text](doc/help.txt).

<b>Note</b>: An RDoc bug that was fixed recently
(PR https://github.com/ruby/rdoc/pull/1002)
caused many (make that many, many) broken links TOC section
https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/table_of_contents.html#classes.
Unless you have a recent Ruby version installed (one that has the bug fix),
the RDocLinkChecker will find and report all those broken links.

<b>Workaround</b>:  Use option <tt>--no_toc</tt>, which suppresses checking
for those links.
