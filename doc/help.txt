Usage:
  rdoc_link_checker html_dirpath options

The argument is the path to a directory containing a tree
of RDoc-generated HTML files, such as those generated by command

  rdoc --visibility=private --op html . # Note the trailing dot.

Options:
  --config filepath   Read configuration from file.  See below.
  --onsite_only       Check link targets only on pages in the file tree at <html_dirpath>,
                      and not those on other local pages or those on the web.
  --no_toc            Do not check links on the TOC page (table_of_contents.html).
  --version           Print the version and exit.
  --help              Print this help and exit.

The output is file <html_dirpath>/Report.htm, which reports broken links.

The configuration file must be a JSON object
(see https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/JSON.html)
consisting of name/value pairs;
the names may include:

- "options": a JSON object consisting of option-name/value pairs;
  the option-names may include:

  - "onsite_only": the value must be true or false (not quoted),
    which sets the onsite_only value.
  - "no_toc": the value must be true or false (not quoted),
    which sets the no_toc value.

- "source_file_omits": a JSON array consisting of double-quoted strings,
  each of which will be used to create a Regexp object;
  a source filepath that matches any of those regexps will not be checked
  for bad links.
